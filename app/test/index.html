                <p>Debt settlement services are not for everyone. Our projections are derived from historical results
                    and will vary based on the specific creditors you are enrolled with and the terms of your individual
                    program. Successful program completion is contingent on various factors, including your ability to
                    accumulate sufficient funds. We cannot assure you that your debts will be settled for a
                    predetermined amount or percentage, nor can we guarantee a specific timeframe for resolution. We do
                    not assume your debts, make monthly creditor payments, or offer advice on tax, bankruptcy,
                    accounting, legal matters, or credit repair services. Availability of our services will vary by
                    state, and our fees are subject to state-specific variations. It is advisable to consult with a tax
                    professional regarding potential tax implications of debt resolution for less than the full balance.
                    Prior to enrollment, thoroughly review and comprehend all program materials. On electronic,
                    telephonic, or written request the company will make available to the consumer a paper copy or
                    copies of agreement. The managing member of CuraDebt Systems, LLC is Eric Pemper; any concerns or

                <p>Establishment of a debt settlement plan may adversely affect your credit rating or credit scores.

                    encompass the entire account, including all fees and interest. Familiarize yourself with all program
